# 🧩 Task 4 — Fetch & Display Users from DummyJSON API

This task demonstrates how to fetch user data from a public REST API (DummyJSON) and display it dynamically in a React application.
It covers real-world concepts such as:

* API integration,

* useEffect for lifecycle methods,

* Asynchronous data fetching using async/await,

* Rendering lists in React.

This small project simulates a basic User Directory UI.
