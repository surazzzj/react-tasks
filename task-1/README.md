# 🧩 Task 1 — Search Filter

This task demonstrates a simple and efficient search filter feature in React. It allows users to type into an input box and instantly filter a list of items based on the search query. As the user types, the list updates in real time, showing only the items that match the entered text.

The project uses React state, list filtering, and case-insensitive search matching to create a smooth and responsive UI.
