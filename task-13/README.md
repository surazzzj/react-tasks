# 🧩 Task 13 - carousel 

This task demonstrates a simple image carousel built using React and Tailwind CSS. It uses React’s useState hook to track the currently active image and provides Previous and Next buttons for navigation. The carousel implements looping logic so users can continuously move forward or backward through the images without reaching an end.
